<h3>Introduction: </h3>
<p>A cutting-edge solution revolutionizing the landscape of online assessments. Our innovative system harnesses the power of artificial intelligence and computer vision to ensure the integrity, security, and fairness of examinations conducted in virtual environments.</p>

<div class="details-img">
    {%for i in geobagriverbankdata%}
    <a href=""><img src="{{ i.geobag_at_riverbank_img.url }}" alt="Your Image Description"></a>
    <p>{{i.image_figure_text}}</p>
    {%endfor%}
</div>

<p>With advanced facial recognition and behavioral analysis capabilities, our system provides real-time monitoring and post-examination insights, empowering educators and institutions to uphold the highest standards of integrity while embracing the flexibility of online learning. </p>

<p>Join us on this journey to redefine the future of examination proctoring and elevate the online education experience for all stakeholders. </p>


 <h3>2. Working Procedures:</h3>

<p>Our Exam proctoring system seamlessly integrates with the webcam of PCs, laptops, or smartphones, capturing real-time video input. Each frame is meticulously resized to a crisp 192x192 resolution and converted into grayscale for optimal analysis. Leveraging advanced computer vision techniques, our system detects subtle signs of suspicious behavior, including deviations in eye gaze, head position, and the presence of unauthorized mobile devices. Utilizing OpenCV's HaarCascade classifier, our system accurately identifies faces and eyes within the frame. Suspicious frames are promptly flagged with a vivid 'suspicious' label in red, while normal behavior is indicated with a reassuring 'normal' label in green. This streamlined process ensures robust monitoring and upholds the integrity of online assessments. </p>

    <p>In our proposed system, we utilize YOLO (You Look Only Once) based Deep Learning architecture to detect the multi-geobag from image or video. There are different versions (v1, v2, v3, v4, v5) available of YOLO. In this case, we used YOLOv3 in our proposed system. YOLOv3 has a very high accuracy while also being able to run in real-time or used for real-time applications. The algorithm uses only one forward propagation pass through the network to make the predictions. YOLOv3 uses a new backbone network Darknet-53 that utilizes residual connections as well as some improvements to the bounding box prediction step, and use of three different scales from which to extract features. The Figure (6) describe the training and testing procedures of the proposed YOLV3 based TSGCS. </p>
